### How to run

Project made with python3 and poetry, make sure that you have both installed

Enter the project folder and execute in the terminal:

`cd dpsys`

`python3 dpsys/__init__.py`

Two files will be created  like so:

`dpsys/managers.json`
`dpsys/watchers.json`

If `__init__.py` is runned again the previously created files will be removed so that the new output will be saved is the same path.
